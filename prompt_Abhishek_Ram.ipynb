For example, if your goal is to learn a new language, break it down into smaller tasks like learning a new vocabulary word each day or practicing for 10 minutes each morning.\n",

      "\t* **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to achieve.\n",
      "\t* **Measurable**: Quantify your goals so you can track progress.\n",
      "\t* **Achievable**: Set realistic goals that are challenging yet attainable.\n",
      "\t* **Relevant**: Align your goals with your values and priorities.\n",
      "\t* **Time-bound**: Set deadlines or timeframes for achieving your goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 4: Create an Action Plan**\n",

      "\n",
      "**Step 5: Track Your Progress**\n",
      "Regularly track your progress and celebrate your successes. Use a journal, spreadsheet, or mobile app to monitor your progress and stay motivated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 6: Be Kind to Yourself and Adjust as Needed**\n",
      "Remember that setbacks are a natural part of the process. Don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter obstacles. Instead, learn from your mistakes and adjust your plan as needed.\n",
