      "3. **Prioritize self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n",
      "4. **Communicate with your employer**: If possible, talk to your manager or HR department about your work-related stress. They may be able to offer support, provide resources, or help you find ways to manage your workload.\n",
      "5. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional support and guidance. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel heard and understood.\n",
      "6. **Consider boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries between your work and personal life. This might mean not checking work emails or taking work calls during your free time.\n",
      "7. **Explore stress-reducing activities**: Engage in activities that help you relax, such as yoga, meditation, or hobbies. These can help you manage stress and improve your overall well-being.\n",
      "8. **Re-evaluate your priorities**: Take a step back and assess your priorities. Ask yourself if there are any changes you can make to your work or personal life that might help reduce stress and improve your overall happiness.\n",
